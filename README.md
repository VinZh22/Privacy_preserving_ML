# Privacy_preserving_ML
Goals : 
- Plot the relationship between $\epsilon_i$ and $\delta_i$.
- Implement the protocol and test: convergence, differential-privacy, practical testing with certain datasets
- Numerical application of convergence and other formulas (specifically for modern cases such as GPTs)
- Compare convergence between DP and no DP case
